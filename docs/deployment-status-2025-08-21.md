# ScanNeo Router - Cloud Run Deployment Status

**Date:** August 21, 2025  
**Session:** Morning Deployment Fix

## üéØ Objective

Deploy the Python worker service to Google Cloud Run to enable route generation functionality.

## üìä Current Status

### ‚úÖ Completed Tasks

1. **TypeScript Strict Null Check Errors - FIXED**
   - Fixed 92 TypeScript errors across 3 files:
     - `packages/shared/src/coverage/grid.ts` (38 errors resolved)
     - `packages/shared/src/coverage/routing.ts` (44 errors resolved)
     - `packages/shared/src/coverage/streets.ts` (10 errors resolved)
   - Added proper null/undefined checks for array access
   - Fixed optional property assignments
   - All files now pass TypeScript compilation

2. **Turbo v2 Compatibility - FIXED**
   - Updated `turbo.json` to use `tasks` instead of deprecated `pipeline` field
   - Resolved Turbo binary installation issues

3. **Commits Pushed**
   - Commit 1: `8468c74` - Fixed TypeScript strict null check errors
   - Commit 2: `98def0c` - Updated turbo.json for Turbo v2

### üöß Current Issues

1. **GitHub Actions Deprecated Artifact Actions**
   - CI/CD pipeline uses deprecated `actions/upload-artifact@v3`
   - Need to upgrade to `v4` in workflow files
   - Affects: Build Applications jobs (admin, navigator, worker)

2. **Coverage Upload Warnings**
   - Coverage files not found (non-critical)
   - Paths: `./apps/*/coverage/lcov.info` not generated
   - This is expected as tests don't generate coverage reports yet

### üìù Next Steps

1. **Fix GitHub Actions Workflows**

   ```yaml
   # Update in .github/workflows/ci.yml and deploy-worker.yml
   - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v3  # Change to v4
   + uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
   ```

2. **Monitor Deployment**
   - Watch for successful CI/CD completion
   - Verify worker deployment to Cloud Run
   - Check Cloud Run logs for worker startup

3. **Test End-to-End Flow**
   - Navigate to https://scanneo-router-admin.vercel.app
   - Create a new route generation job
   - Verify worker picks up and processes the job
   - Check route appears in UI

## üîß Technical Details

### Environment

- **Region:** europe-west2 (London)
- **Service:** scanneo-worker
- **Artifact Registry:** `europe-west2-docker.pkg.dev/scanneo-webapp/scanneo-docker`
- **Database:** Neon PostgreSQL (production)

### Worker Service Components

- FastAPI application with async lifespan
- Job polling every 30 seconds from `coverage_routes` table
- Chinese Postman algorithm for route optimization
- OSM street data fetching via Overpass API
- Route chunking (30min-2hr configurable)

### CI/CD Pipeline Stages

1. ‚úÖ Lint & Format Check - PASSING
2. ‚úÖ TypeScript Check - PASSING
3. ‚úÖ Unit Tests - PASSING (with coverage warnings)
4. ‚ö†Ô∏è Build Applications - FAILING (deprecated actions)
5. ‚è∏Ô∏è Deploy Worker - BLOCKED (waiting for build)

## üí° Quick Commands

```bash
# Check latest workflow status
gh run list --limit 3

# View detailed logs
gh run view <RUN_ID> --log

# Monitor Cloud Run deployment (after CI passes)
gcloud run services describe scanneo-worker --region europe-west2

# Check worker logs
gcloud logging read "resource.type=cloud_run_revision AND resource.labels.service_name=scanneo-worker" --limit 50

# Test worker locally
cd apps/worker
docker build -t scanneo-worker .
docker run -p 8000:8000 --env-file .env.local scanneo-worker
```

## üìå Important Notes

- TypeScript configuration uses very strict settings:
  - `strictNullChecks: true`
  - `noUncheckedIndexedAccess: true`
  - `exactOptionalPropertyTypes: true`
- All future code must handle these strict checks
- Worker polls database directly (no queue system yet)
- Route generation is compute-intensive (may take minutes for large areas)

- **GitHub Repo:** https://github.com/ChrisScanNeo/ScanNeo-Router
- **GCP Console:** https://console.cloud.google.com/run?project=scanneo-webapp

**Status when you return:** CI/CD pipeline needs artifact action version update to complete deployment. Once fixed, worker should auto-deploy to Cloud Run and be ready for testing.
