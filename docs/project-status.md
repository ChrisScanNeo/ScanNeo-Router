# ScanNeo-Router Project Status

## Project Overview

ScanNeo-Router is a city coverage routing system designed to generate optimal driving routes for complete street coverage, with real-time navigation and rerouting capabilities.

```

## Completed Setup

### 1. Repository Initialization

- ✅ Git repository initialized with main branch
- ✅ Initial commit created

### 2. Monorepo Configuration

- ✅ PNPM workspace configured (`pnpm-workspace.yaml`)
- ✅ Turborepo setup for task orchestration (`turbo.json`)
- ✅ Root `package.json` with workspace scripts

### 3. Code Quality Tools

- ✅ ESLint configuration (`.eslintrc.js`)
- ✅ Prettier configuration (`.prettierrc` and `.prettierignore`)
- ✅ TypeScript strict mode configuration (`tsconfig.json`)
- ✅ Commitlint for conventional commits (`commitlint.config.js`)
- ✅ Husky git hooks for pre-commit checks (`.husky/`)

### 4. Development Standards

- ✅ Comprehensive development guidelines in `CLAUDE.md`
- ✅ Testing standards defined
- ✅ Component structure patterns established
- ✅ API standards documented
- ✅ Security and performance requirements set

## Planned Architecture

### Applications (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Admin Dashboard** (`/apps/admin`)
   - Next.js application for administrative interface
   - Deployment target: Vercel

2. **Navigator Mobile App** (`/apps/navigator`)
   - React Native application built with Expo
   - Real-time navigation and routing interface

3. **Worker Service** (`/apps/worker`)
   - Python-based worker for processing coverage algorithms
   - Deployment target: Google Cloud Run

### Shared Packages (Not Yet Implemented)

1. **Shared Utilities** (`/packages/shared`)
   - Common TypeScript types and utilities
   - Custom React hooks
   - API client libraries

2. **UI Components** (`/packages/ui`)
   - Reusable React/React Native components
   - Theming and styling system

3. **Configuration** (`/packages/config`)
   - Shared configuration files
   - Environment variable management

### Infrastructure (Planned)

- **Database**: PostgreSQL with PostGIS (Neon)
- **Routing API**: OpenRouteService
- **Authentication**: JWT-based auth system
- **File Storage**: Cloud storage for route data
- **Monitoring**: Application performance monitoring

## Testing Strategy (Defined but Not Implemented)

### Test Categories

- Unit tests for components and utilities
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- E2E tests for critical user flows
- Visual regression testing with Storybook
- Performance testing for routing algorithms

### Test Locations

```
/scripts
├── /auth           # Authentication tests
├── /coverage       # Coverage algorithm tests
├── /navigation     # Navigation logic tests
├── /api            # API endpoint tests
├── /e2e            # End-to-end tests
└── /integration    # Integration tests
```

## Development Workflow

### Established Conventions

- **Git Flow**: Feature branches with conventional commits
- **Code Review**: Required for all PRs
- **Testing**: TDD approach with 80% coverage target
- **Documentation**: JSDoc for all public APIs
- **Performance**: Mobile-first optimization

### Available Commands

```bash
pnpm install        # Install dependencies
pnpm dev           # Start all apps in development
pnpm test          # Run test suite
pnpm lint          # Run ESLint
pnpm format        # Format with Prettier
pnpm typecheck     # TypeScript type checking
pnpm build         # Build all applications
```

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities

1. [ ] Create base application structures (`/apps/*`)
2. [ ] Set up shared packages (`/packages/*`)
3. [ ] Configure database connection and schemas
4. [ ] Implement authentication system
5. [ ] Create base UI components
6. [ ] Set up CI/CD pipelines

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure
