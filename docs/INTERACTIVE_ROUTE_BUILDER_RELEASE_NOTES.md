# Interactive Route Builder - Release Notes & Testing Guide

**Version**: 1.0.0  
**Release Date**: 2024-08-25  
**Status**: Ready for Testing

## üéØ Overview

The Interactive Route Builder is a new feature that provides step-by-step control over street coverage route generation. It addresses real-world challenges in urban navigation, particularly optimized for London's complex street network with one-way systems, access restrictions, and disconnected zones.

## üöÄ New Features

### 1. Interactive Route Builder UI (`/routes/builder`)

A comprehensive 7-step workflow for creating coverage routes:

- **Step 1**: Area Selection
- **Step 2**: Street Extraction from OpenStreetMap
- **Step 3**: Network Graph Building
- **Step 4**: Starting Point Selection
- **Step 5**: Route Generation
- **Step 6**: Gap Resolution
- **Step 7**: Route Finalization

Access via:

- Click "Interactive Builder" button on `/routes` page
- Direct URL: `/routes/builder`
- With pre-selected area: `/routes/builder?area={area-id}`

### 2. Enhanced Street Extraction

#### API Endpoints

**`POST /api/areas/[id]/extract-streets`**

- Fetches streets from OpenStreetMap with configurable filtering
- Request body options:
  ```json
  {
    "includeServiceRoads": false,
    "includePrivateRoads": false,
    "respectRestrictions": true,
    "maxAreaSqKm": 10
  }
  ```
- Returns detailed extraction statistics

**`GET /api/areas/[id]/streets`**

- Retrieves previously extracted streets from database
- Returns GeoJSON FeatureCollection with metadata

#### Street Filtering

**Included by Default:**

- Motorways and motorway links
- Trunk roads and trunk links
- Primary, secondary, tertiary roads (and their links)
- Residential streets
- Unclassified roads
- Living streets

**Excluded by Default:**

- Footways, paths, cycleways
- Pedestrian areas
- Steps, tracks, bridleways
- Construction/abandoned roads
- Driveways, parking aisles (unless service roads enabled)
- Private access roads (unless private roads enabled)

### 3. Real-World Constraint Detection

The system now identifies and tracks:

- **One-way streets**: Detected via OSM `oneway` tags
- **Bus gates**: Roads restricted to buses only
- **Access restrictions**: Private, customer-only, delivery-only
- **Dead-ends**: Cul-de-sacs and turning circles
- **LTNs**: Low Traffic Neighbourhoods
- **Time-based restrictions**: School streets, timed access

### 4. Visual Map Features

**Color Coding:**

- üîµ **Blue**: Area boundaries
- üü¢ **Green**: Two-way streets
- üî¥ **Red**: One-way streets
- üü° **Yellow**: Gap locations
- üü¢ **Green Marker**: Selected start point

**Map Controls:**

- Zoom in/out with mouse wheel or buttons
- Pan by clicking and dragging
- Fullscreen mode available
- Auto-fit to area bounds

### 5. Gap Detection & Resolution

When the route generator finds disconnected segments, you can:

1. **Auto-connect**: Use routing API to find drivable path
2. **Manual connection**: Draw custom path (coming soon)
3. **Skip gap**: Leave disconnected for separate coverage passes

### 6. Area Size Validation

- Warns if area exceeds 10 km¬≤
- Recommends splitting large areas into zones
- Shows area size in extraction results

4. **GPX Export** - Button exists but export functionality coming soon
5. **Coverage tracking** - GPS trace upload feature planned for next release

### Potential Issues

| Issue                | Cause                | Solution                                 |
| -------------------- | -------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Map not loading      | Missing Mapbox token | Check Vercel environment variables       |
| Streets not visible  | Map not fully loaded | Wait for loading spinner to complete     |
| Area not in dropdown | API response format  | Refresh page, check console              |
| Extraction fails     | OSM API timeout      | Try again or reduce area size            |
| Many gaps detected   | Disconnected network | Check for rivers, railways dividing area |

## üìä Expected Results

### For "Localtest" Area

Based on your test area, you should see approximately:

- **Total streets**: 60-80 (depending on filters)
- **One-way streets**: 5-15
- **Two-way streets**: 45-65
- **Dead-ends**: 2-5
- **Total length**: 5-15 km

### Extraction Times

- Small area (< 2 km¬≤): 5-10 seconds
- Medium area (2-5 km¬≤): 10-20 seconds
- Large area (5-10 km¬≤): 20-40 seconds

## üîß Configuration

### Environment Variables

Ensure these are set in Vercel:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_TOKEN=your_mapbox_token_here
DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_connection_string
```

### Database Tables Used

- `areas` - Stores coverage area polygons
- `edges` - Stores extracted street segments
- `coverage_routes` - Stores generated routes (when saved)

## üìù Data Flow

1. **Area Selection** ‚Üí Fetches from `areas` table
2. **Street Extraction** ‚Üí Calls Overpass API ‚Üí Stores in `edges` table
3. **Graph Building** ‚Üí In-memory NetworkX graph (Python worker)
4. **Route Generation** ‚Üí Chinese Postman algorithm (Python worker)
5. **Gap Resolution** ‚Üí OpenRouteService API for connections
6. **Save Route** ‚Üí Stores in `coverage_routes` table

## üéì Tips for Testing

1. **Start Small**: Test with your Localtest area first
2. **Check Statistics**: Verify street counts match expectations
3. **Try Different Filters**: Test all checkbox combinations
4. **Monitor Console**: Keep developer console open for debugging
5. **Test Repeatedly**: Try the same area multiple times

## üì∏ What to Look For

### Visual Confirmations

- ‚úÖ Blue boundary around selected area
- ‚úÖ Green lines for two-way streets
- ‚úÖ Red lines for one-way streets
- ‚úÖ Streets fit within area boundary
- ‚úÖ Green marker at start point
- ‚úÖ Loading spinner while processing

### Statistical Confirmations

- ‚úÖ Street count reasonable for area size
- ‚úÖ One-way percentage typical for area type
- ‚úÖ Total length proportional to area size
- ‚úÖ Extraction time under 1 minute

## üö¶ Success Criteria

The feature is working correctly if you can:

1. ‚úÖ Select an area and see it on the map
2. ‚úÖ Extract streets with visible results
3. ‚úÖ See different results with different filters
4. ‚úÖ Progress through all 7 steps
5. ‚úÖ Save a route (even if mock data for now)
