# ScanNeo Router - Development Status Report

**Date: 2024-08-24**

## Executive Summary

Today we identified and fixed critical issues in the route generation worker's gap handling logic. While significant progress was made, the system still requires further optimization as gaps continue to appear in the final repair phase.

## Key Achievements Today

### 1. âœ… Fixed Database Schema Issues

- **Problem**: Worker couldn't pick up jobs due to incorrect column references
- **Solution**: Updated queries to use top-level `status` column instead of `params->>'status'`
- **Impact**: Jobs now properly transition from 'queued' to 'processing'

### 2. âœ… Resolved API Data Synchronization

- **Problem**: Admin dashboard showed incorrect job status
- **Solution**: Updated all API endpoints to read from new schema columns
- **Impact**: Real-time job status now displays correctly

### 3. ðŸ”§ Identified Critical Gap Handling Bug

- **Problem**: Main stitching phase was creating new gaps while trying to fix existing ones
- **Solution**: Restructured logic to properly handle three cases:
  - No gap (<1mm): Just append segment
  - Small gap (â‰¤20m): Bridge with direct join
  - Large gap (>20m): Route with OpenRouteService
- **Status**: Partially effective - gaps still appearing in final repair

## Current Issues

### Persistent Gap Problem

Despite fixes, the final repair phase is still finding significant gaps:

- 27.4m gaps at indices 88, 95
- 33.6m gap at index 81
- 70.0m gap at index 53
- 346.3m gaps at indices 23, 26

**Root Cause Analysis**:

1. The main stitching phase may not be iterating through all edges correctly
2. Edge geometries might not be properly aligned to nodes
3. The circuit generation might be creating disconnected segments

## Job Processing Performance

### Before Fixes

- Jobs wouldn't start (stuck in 'pending')
- When manually triggered, took 10+ minutes
- 50+ gaps requiring ORS API calls in final repair

### After Fixes

- Jobs automatically picked up and processed
- Still taking 5-10 minutes due to final repair
- 10-20 gaps still requiring ORS API calls

- **15:20 GMT**: API synchronization fixes deployed
- **15:35 GMT**: Critical gap handling bug fix deployed

## Metrics & Monitoring

### Current Job Status (as of 15:42 BST)

- Status: Processing
- Progress: ~75% (estimated)
- Gaps found in final repair: 6+
- ORS API calls in final repair: 6+

### Gap Distribution

- Small gaps (20-40m): 3 occurrences
- Medium gaps (70m): 1 occurrence
- Large gaps (340m+): 2 occurrences

## Next Steps for Tomorrow

### Priority 1: Investigate Main Phase Failure

- Add comprehensive logging to track every edge in the circuit
- Verify that all edges are being processed
- Check if edge geometries are properly aligned

### Priority 2: Optimize Gap Thresholds

- Consider increasing threshold to 30-40m
- Implement adaptive thresholds based on gap distribution
- Add pre-processing to identify and fix common gap patterns

### Priority 3: Graph Building Analysis

- Verify the Chinese Postman algorithm implementation
- Check if the Eulerian circuit is truly continuous
- Investigate why 346m gaps are appearing

### Priority 4: Performance Optimization

- Implement batch ORS requests for multiple gaps
- Cache common route segments
- Add circuit validation before stitching

## Technical Debt Identified

1. **Test Coverage**: Gap bridging tests are failing and need updates
2. **Error Handling**: Need better recovery from ORS API failures
3. **Monitoring**: Need metrics on gap sizes and distributions
4. **Documentation**: Gap handling logic needs detailed documentation

## Dependencies & External Services

### OpenRouteService API

- Status: Operational
- Response time: 2-3 seconds per request
- Daily limit: Sufficient for current load

### Database (Neon PostgreSQL)

- Status: Healthy
- Connection pool: Working correctly
- PostGIS: Functioning properly

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions

1. Add extensive logging in the main stitching phase
2. Implement gap size histogram for analysis
3. Create unit tests for gap handling scenarios

### Medium-term Improvements

1. Implement local routing fallback for small gaps
2. Pre-process graph to ensure edge connectivity
3. Add circuit validation before processing

### Long-term Solutions

1. Consider alternative routing algorithms
2. Implement custom local router for small gaps
3. Add machine learning for gap prediction

## Configuration Notes

### Current Settings

```python
SNAP_EPS_M = 1.0     # Snap threshold
SMALL_JOIN_M = 20.0  # Direct join threshold
MAX_GAP_M = 30.0     # Maximum allowed gap
POLL_INTERVAL = 30   # Job polling interval (seconds)
```

### Recommended Adjustments

- Increase `SMALL_JOIN_M` to 30-40m
- Add adaptive thresholds based on area characteristics
- Implement progressive gap handling strategies

## Summary

Today's work successfully resolved critical infrastructure issues that were preventing job processing. However, the core algorithmic challenge of gap handling remains partially unsolved. The system is functional but requires further optimization to achieve production-ready performance.

**Overall Status**: ðŸŸ¡ Partially Operational

- Jobs process successfully but slowly
- Excessive API calls in final repair phase
- Route generation completes with warnings

**Tomorrow's Focus**: Deep dive into why the main stitching phase isn't catching gaps that should be obvious, potentially requiring a fundamental review of the graph building and circuit generation logic.
