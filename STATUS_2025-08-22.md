# ScanNeo-Router Status Report

**Date: August 22-23, 2025**

## üéØ Session Summary

Day 1 (Aug 22): Diagnosed and fixed critical issues with the Chinese Postman route generation algorithm that were causing routes to have large gaps and complete with warnings.

Day 2 (Aug 23): Investigated job processing issues where worker appears to be processing but not updating database status.

## ‚úÖ Issues Resolved

### 1. ORS API Integration Fixed

- **Problem**: Routes were using straight-line connections (448m gaps) instead of actual roads
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues with OpenRouteService API integration:
  - Wrong endpoint URL (`/geojson` instead of `/json`)
  - Invalid request parameters (`geometry_format` not supported)
  - Missing polyline decoding (only returning 2 waypoints instead of full route)
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed endpoint URL to use `/json` format
  - Removed invalid parameters
  - Added polyline decoding to get full route geometry (73 points vs 2)
  - Added `polyline==2.0.2` dependency

### 2. API Key Configuration

- **Status**: ‚úÖ ORS API key is properly configured in production
- **Verification**: Created `/diagnostics` and `/test-ors` endpoints to verify configuration
- **Result**: Key is present, valid, and working (120 characters, starts with "eyJvcmci")

### 3. Test Infrastructure

- **Added**: DELETE endpoint for routes (`/api/routes/[id]`)
- **Cleaned**: Removed 6 old test routes from database
- **Status**: Database is clean and ready for testing

## üìä Current System State

### Production Deployment

- **Worker Version**: 1.0.3
- **Status**: Deployed and healthy
- **URL**: https://scanneo-worker-dgseb5nz7q-nw.a.run.app
- **Database**: Connected
- **ORS**: Configured and working (returns 73 points for test route)

### Key Metrics

```json
{
  "ors_enabled": true,
  "route_points": 73, // Was 2 before fix
  "distance_m": 2428.6, // Actual road distance
  "used_ors": true, // Not using fallback
  "api_key_length": 120 // Valid key present
}
```

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Outstanding Issues (Updated Aug 23)

### 1. Database Update Problem

- **Issue**: Worker appears to be processing jobs (ORS API calls visible in logs) but database status remains "pending"
- **Evidence**:
  - Worker logs show active ORS route calculations
  - Database shows jobs still in "pending" status
  - Job IDs: `b22e3558-92bb-4b4c-be26-d20838d689c5`, `48feb35c-354c-4786-b3f8-2fc4fe1a0d80`
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  - Reset stuck job via admin endpoint ‚úÖ
  - Created new test job ‚úÖ
  - Restarted worker service ‚úÖ
  - All fixes unsuccessful - jobs remain pending
- **Root Cause**: Likely a disconnect between job processing and database updates

### 2. Job Polling Issue

- Worker health checks pass but jobs aren't transitioning from pending to processing
- May be an issue with the database transaction or connection pooling
- Could be timing out during long route calculations without updating status

## üìÅ Files Modified Today

### Core Fixes

- `/apps/worker/app/services/ors_client.py` - Fixed ORS API integration and added polyline decoding
- `/apps/worker/app/config.py` - Corrected ORS endpoint URL
- `/apps/worker/requirements.txt` - Added polyline dependency
- `/apps/worker/app/services/graph_builder.py` - Fixed spatial index query bug

### Diagnostics & Testing

- `/apps/worker/main.py` - Added `/diagnostics` and `/test-ors` endpoints
- `/apps/admin/app/api/routes/[id]/route.ts` - Added DELETE method

### Documentation

- `/CHINESE_POSTMAN_FIX.md` - Updated with test results
- `/ORS_SETUP.md` - Created setup guide for ORS API key

## üöÄ Next Steps (Critical)

1. **Fix Database Update Issue**
   - Check if worker is successfully claiming jobs from database
   - Verify database transactions are committing properly
   - Add more detailed logging around job status updates
   - Consider adding a test endpoint to manually trigger job processing

2. **Debug Job Processing**
   - Add logging to show when a job is claimed
   - Log each database update attempt
   - Check for transaction rollbacks or connection pool issues
   - Monitor memory usage during processing

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Consider using a simpler polling mechanism
   - Add a manual job trigger endpoint for testing
   - Implement a job heartbeat to track processing progress
   - Add database query logging to see what's actually happening

4. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Add endpoint to show currently processing jobs
   - Implement detailed job history tracking
   - Add metrics for job processing time and success rate

## üí° Key Learnings

1. **API Integration**: Small details matter - wrong endpoint format caused complete failure
2. **Polyline Decoding**: Essential for getting actual route geometry from ORS
3. **Testing**: Need better end-to-end testing to catch these issues earlier
4. **Monitoring**: Need better visibility into worker processing state

## üìù Commands for Quick Testing

```bash
# Check worker health
curl -s https://scanneo-worker-dgseb5nz7q-nw.a.run.app/health | jq .

# Test ORS integration
curl -s https://scanneo-worker-dgseb5nz7q-nw.a.run.app/test-ors | jq .

# Create new route job (replace area_id)
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/routes \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"area_id": "YOUR_AREA_ID", "profile": "driving-car", "chunkDuration": 1800}'

# Check job status
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/routes/JOB_ID | jq .
```

## üèÅ Current State (Aug 23, 10:15 UTC)

### ‚úÖ Working Components

- **Chinese Postman Algorithm**: Fixed with proper road routing
- **ORS Integration**: Fully functional with polyline decoding (73 points returned)
- **Worker Health**: Service is healthy and running
- **Admin Interface**: All endpoints functional
- **Database**: Connected and accessible

### ‚ùå Not Working

- **Job Processing**: Jobs remain in "pending" despite worker activity
- **Status Updates**: Database not reflecting processing state changes
- **End-to-End Flow**: Cannot complete a full route generation

### üîç Key Observations

- Worker logs show active ORS API calls (connecting route segments)
- Database shows jobs still pending after multiple polling cycles
- Worker restart didn't resolve the issue
- Job reset endpoint works but jobs still don't get processed

### üéØ Next Session Priority

**CRITICAL**: Fix the disconnect between worker processing and database updates. The worker appears to be processing jobs (based on ORS API calls in logs) but not updating the database status, preventing job completion.
