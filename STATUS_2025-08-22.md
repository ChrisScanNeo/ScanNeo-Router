# ScanNeo-Router Status Report

**Date: August 22-23, 2025**

## 🎯 Session Summary

Day 1 (Aug 22): Diagnosed and fixed critical issues with the Chinese Postman route generation algorithm that were causing routes to have large gaps and complete with warnings.

Day 2 (Aug 23): Investigated job processing issues where worker appears to be processing but not updating database status.

## ✅ Issues Resolved

### 1. ORS API Integration Fixed

- **Problem**: Routes were using straight-line connections (448m gaps) instead of actual roads
- **Root Cause**: Multiple issues with OpenRouteService API integration:
  - Wrong endpoint URL (`/geojson` instead of `/json`)
  - Invalid request parameters (`geometry_format` not supported)
  - Missing polyline decoding (only returning 2 waypoints instead of full route)
- **Solution**:
  - Fixed endpoint URL to use `/json` format
  - Removed invalid parameters
  - Added polyline decoding to get full route geometry (73 points vs 2)
  - Added `polyline==2.0.2` dependency

### 2. API Key Configuration

- **Status**: ✅ ORS API key is properly configured in production
- **Verification**: Created `/diagnostics` and `/test-ors` endpoints to verify configuration
- **Result**: Key is present, valid, and working (120 characters, starts with "eyJvcmci")

### 3. Test Infrastructure

- **Added**: DELETE endpoint for routes (`/api/routes/[id]`)
- **Cleaned**: Removed 6 old test routes from database
- **Status**: Database is clean and ready for testing

## 📊 Current System State

### Production Deployment

- **Worker Version**: 1.0.3
- **Status**: Deployed and healthy
- **URL**: https://scanneo-worker-dgseb5nz7q-nw.a.run.app
- **Database**: Connected
- **ORS**: Configured and working (returns 73 points for test route)

### Key Metrics

```json
{
  "ors_enabled": true,
  "route_points": 73, // Was 2 before fix
  "distance_m": 2428.6, // Actual road distance
  "used_ors": true, // Not using fallback
  "api_key_length": 120 // Valid key present
}
```

## ⚠️ Outstanding Issues (Updated Aug 23)

### 1. Database Update Problem

- **Issue**: Worker appears to be processing jobs (ORS API calls visible in logs) but database status remains "pending"
- **Evidence**:
  - Worker logs show active ORS route calculations
  - Database shows jobs still in "pending" status
  - Job IDs: `b22e3558-92bb-4b4c-be26-d20838d689c5`, `48feb35c-354c-4786-b3f8-2fc4fe1a0d80`
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  - Reset stuck job via admin endpoint ✅
  - Created new test job ✅
  - Restarted worker service ✅
  - All fixes unsuccessful - jobs remain pending
- **Root Cause**: Likely a disconnect between job processing and database updates

### 2. Job Polling Issue

- Worker health checks pass but jobs aren't transitioning from pending to processing
- May be an issue with the database transaction or connection pooling
- Could be timing out during long route calculations without updating status

## 🚀 Next Steps (Critical)

1. **Fix Database Update Issue**
   - Check if worker is successfully claiming jobs from database
   - Verify database transactions are committing properly
   - Add more detailed logging around job status updates
   - Consider adding a test endpoint to manually trigger job processing

2. **Debug Job Processing**
   - Add logging to show when a job is claimed
   - Log each database update attempt
   - Check for transaction rollbacks or connection pool issues
   - Monitor memory usage during processing

3. **Alternative Approaches**
   - Consider using a simpler polling mechanism
   - Add a manual job trigger endpoint for testing
   - Implement a job heartbeat to track processing progress
   - Add database query logging to see what's actually happening

4. **Monitoring Improvements**
   - Add endpoint to show currently processing jobs
   - Implement detailed job history tracking
   - Add metrics for job processing time and success rate

## 💡 Key Learnings

1. **API Integration**: Small details matter - wrong endpoint format caused complete failure
2. **Polyline Decoding**: Essential for getting actual route geometry from ORS
3. **Testing**: Need better end-to-end testing to catch these issues earlier
4. **Monitoring**: Need better visibility into worker processing state

### 🔍 CRITICAL BUG FOUND - Infinite Loop Root Cause Identified

After adding extensive debug logging, we've identified the exact cause of the infinite loop:

#### The Problem

1. **Initial Success**: The route connector DOES successfully connect components:

```log
✅ Found best connection: (-1.0636006000000005, 50.8026249) -> (-1.0633860000000002, 50.80196039999999)
🔗 CONNECTING source (-1.0636006000000005, 50.8026249) to route start (-1.0636, 50.80262) (0.5m)
🔗 CONNECTING route end (-1.06339, 50.80196) to target (-1.0633860000000002, 50.80196039999999) (0.3m)
Reduced to 1 components (was 2)
✅ SUCCESS: Path exists between source and target
Successfully connected all components
```

2. **Then Mysteriously**: After success, we see:

```log
Making graph Eulerian...
Found 50 nodes with odd degree
Computing shortest paths between odd nodes...
[MORE ORS CALLS]
Reduced to 3 components  <-- WHERE DID THESE COME FROM?
```

#### Root Causes Identified

1. **Floating Point Precision Issues**:
   - Source node: `-1.0636006000000005, 50.8026249`
   - Route start: `[-1.0636, 50.80262]`
   - These are the same location but don't match due to precision
   - Causes unnecessary micro-connections (0.5m, 0.3m)

2. **Recursive/Duplicate Route Connector Calls**:
   - The route connector is being called AGAIN after it already succeeded
   - This appears to be happening during the "Making graph Eulerian" phase
   - The graph is being modified in a way that creates NEW disconnected components

#### Code Analysis

The issue is in the flow between these components:

**route_calculator.py**:

```python
# Step 2: Connect disconnected components
G = await self.route_connector.connect_components(G)
# Successfully connects: 2 components -> 1 component ✅

# Step 3: Make graph Eulerian
G_eulerian, matching_stats = await self._make_eulerian(G)
# Something here is breaking the connectivity!
```

**Likely culprit in \_make_eulerian**:

- When adding edges for odd-degree node matching
- The algorithm might be creating edges that don't properly connect
- Or it's calling route connector again internally

#### The Infinite Loop Pattern

```
1. Start with 4 components
2. Try to connect them
3. Successfully reduce to 1 component
4. Make Eulerian process breaks it back to 3-4 components
5. Try to connect again (same distances: 1m, 41m, 166m, etc.)
6. REPEAT FOREVER
```

### 🔧 Proposed Solutions

1. **Fix Floating Point Precision**:

```python
# Round coordinates to reasonable precision (6 decimal places = ~0.1m accuracy)
def normalize_coord(coord):
    return (round(coord[0], 6), round(coord[1], 6))
```

2. **Fix the Make Eulerian Process**:
   - Ensure it doesn't break connectivity
   - Don't call route connector recursively
   - Verify graph remains connected after adding matching edges

3. **Add Safety Check**:

```python
# After making Eulerian, verify still connected
if not nx.is_weakly_connected(G_eulerian):
    logger.error("Graph became disconnected during Eulerian conversion!")
    # Don't try to reconnect - fail fast instead
```

### 📊 Evidence from Logs

**Successful Connection**:

```
11:38:58 - Connecting components 0 and 1 with 81m route
11:38:58 - Source node: (-1.0636006000000005, 50.8026249)
11:38:58 - Target node: (-1.0633860000000002, 50.80196039999999)
11:38:58 - Reduced to 1 components (was 2)
11:38:58 - ✅ SUCCESS: Path exists between nodes
11:38:58 - Successfully connected all components
```

**Then Mysteriously Broken Again**:

```
11:38:59 - Making graph Eulerian...
11:38:59 - Found 50 nodes with odd degree
11:38:59 - Reduced to 3 components  <-- PROBLEM!
```

### 🎯 Next Steps

1. **Check \_make_eulerian method** for any code that modifies the graph incorrectly
2. **Add coordinate normalization** to handle floating point precision
3. **Add connectivity verification** after each graph modification
4. **Remove any recursive calls** to route_connector
